# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Pygame)

A simple 2-player **Tic-Tac-Toe** game built using Python and **Pygame**. This project follows a clean architecture with class-based design, player moves, win-checking logic, and GUI rendering — all implemented using Pygame.

## 📌 Features

- Grid-based 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe board  
- Two-player game with "X" and "O" turns  
- Win detection (rows, columns, diagonals)  
- Pygame-based visual interface with clean graphics  
- Prints winning player in the terminal

## 🧠 Project Architecture

1. **Design** the game architecture and identify the key features  
2. **Create a `Game` class** with attributes like board, players, and game state  
3. **Implement methods** for making moves, checking wins, and switching turns  
4. **Use Pygame**, a built-in Python library, for GUI rendering  
5. **Test the game** with sample player moves and win conditions
