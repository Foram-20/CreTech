# 🤖 Simple Chatbot

A beginner-friendly, rule-based chatbot created using Python and NLTK. This project demonstrates how natural language processing can be implemented using regular expressions to handle basic user input and generate meaningful responses.

---

## 📌 Features

- Responds to greetings, questions, emotions, and common phrases
- Uses Python's NLTK library (`nltk.chat.util`) and `reflections`
- Pattern matching with regular expressions
- Command-line interface chatbot experience
- Predefined responses for jokes, programming questions, and more

---

## 🧠 Project Requirements

1.  **Design** the chatbot architecture and identify the key features.
2.  **Implement** methods for processing user input and generating responses.
3.  **Use** Python's built-in libraries like **NLTK** for natural language processing.
4.  **Test** the chatbot with sample data.
