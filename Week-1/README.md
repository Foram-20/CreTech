## 🧠 Project Architecture

1. **Design the chatbot structure** and define key intents (greetings, questions, emotions, etc.)
2. **Implement regex-based rules** for user input and bot replies.
3. Use **Python’s NLTK library** for natural language parsing and reflection-based replies.
4. **Test with sample user inputs** to refine and verify bot behavior.
